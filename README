Welcome to Snippetz!

I wrote this simple web application after being frustrated by the lack of tools available to store simple snippets of code I often need to reuse on various web projects. I have looked at pastebin and snipplr.com but neither seem to offer what I needed. This was also a chance for me to try out the PHP framework Kohana and the MVC design pattern. To get started using Snippetz you need to first register for an account.

Kohana framework vrs : 2.3.4
      --> Auth module
      --> swift mail

Database used        : MySql
